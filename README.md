This is a fork of [*Chimpy*](https://github.com/TheBrainFamily/chimpy), which will be developed and maintained by [TheBrain team](http://team.thebrain.pro).  Unfortunately Chimpy does not use the latest ChromeDriver and we needed it.  It also includes a couple of patches.

See the [History](https://github.com/CherryCircle/chimpy/blob/master/HISTORY.md) to figure out which version contains the correct ChromeDriver you are looking for.
